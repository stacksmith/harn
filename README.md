# HARN
`harn` is a fine-grained interactive linker (toy) for a (subset of) C, licensed under GPL v3.0.  What can you do with it?

`harn` is an attempt to create a REPL-like environment for editing, recompiling, and relinking and executing individual functions and manipulating data objects, from inside a running process.  

The system aims to enable interactive C code development Ã  la Lisp or Forth, blending the coding, debugging, and testing into a single environment.

`harn` maintains the bookkeeping data and manages the `coding-time` referential integrity and garbage collection, keeping all code hot and functions individually accessible. 

The approach tried here is to keep linked and relocated code in an image-like environment complete with sources and allow incremental re-compilation of functions by harnessing gcc.  The system maintains enough individual state (prototypes, headers, etc) to concoct function-level compilation units and raids the resultant ELF object file.


## Technical Limitations

C is not an ideal language for this kind of interaction, and some hard issues are being resolved.  It is a goal of this project to use a reasonable subset of C and an unmodified gcc to produce the artifacts.

The system allows editing and recompilation of sub-file units, namely code fragments containing a single global object such as a function or a variable.  The resulting artifact is stored, along with source and other metadata.

Each artifact must be either functional, with a single global function (and possibly additional local functions and read-only data, or a global data object.

Functions are fully described by the headers automatically-extracted during compilation and made available to the rest of the system.  Data objects are potentially much more complicated, both in terms of access (unlike functions with a single entry point and generally-trivial callsites, data objects may be accessed in many unanticipated ways), structure, and pervasiveness in multiple functions - potentially requiring recompilation of many artifacts upon change...

Current handling of data is largely manual, requiring careful usage of headers for declaring types and global variables.
